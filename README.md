# Face_recognition
Small facial recognition project derivative of many of the others I've seen around. I used the Haar Cascade Profile as well as VGG 16 to isolate images of human faces and learn/recognize them, respectively.
To run the program, download all the files in one folder, and run the GUI file in your compiler.
